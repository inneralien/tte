This is a command line tool that reads a CSV file containing a series of
transactions and generates an accounts balance output file also in CSV.

.The goals are
* Update client accounts
* Handle disputes
* Handle chargebacks
* Ouput the state of clients accounts


## Example Input and Output

.Example Transactions Input Data
[source,csv]
----
type,       client,     tx,     amount
deposit,         1,     1,         1.0
deposit,         2,     2,         2.0
deposit,         1,     3,         2.0
withdrawal,      1,     4,         1.5
withdrawal,      2,     5,         3.0
----

IMPORTANT: The assumption is that there *will* be a header line in the CSV file
that will be skipped when parsing. If this assumption is false then it's
possible that the first transaction will be skipped inadvertently.

.Example Accounts Output Data
